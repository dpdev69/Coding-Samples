/* This is a very simple Java program that will print some stuff about
 * the history of the Java programming language.  
 * Try running the program to see it working.  
 * 
 * Obviously, the facts stated in the output are not correct
 * because there are several possible words with slashes between!  
 * FIX THEM by editing the source-code below - changing as little as 
 * possible on each line, and then submit the project.
 * For information that is incorrect (i.e. your name), completely
 * erase the old one and insert the correct information in its place. 
 * When taking out the incorrect options, delete them and the slashes
 * that appear between the options so that the result reads as a 
 * correct sentence.  Use
 * http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/javahistory-index-198355.html 
 * to determine which value is correct in each set.  
 * Please don't change the overall meaning of each 
 * item in the output or change the other words around it.
 * 
 * Please don't add or remove any lines from the output -- otherwise you will 
 * confuse the automated testing setup and you are likely not to pass the tests!
 * (This is not the time to be creative!)
