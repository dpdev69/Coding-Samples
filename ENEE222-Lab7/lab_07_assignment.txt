(Total Points: 15)


Consider the function s(t) defined for t in [0,4) by

                  { sin(pi*t/2)  , for t in [0,1)
           s(t) = { -(t-2)^5     , for t in [1,3)
                  { sin(pi*t/2)  , for t in [3,4)

(i)   Generate a column vector s consisting of 512 uniform
      samples of this function over the interval [0,4). (This
      is best done by concatenating three vectors.)

(ii)  If V is the normalized Haar wavelet matrix of size
      512, determine the vector c such that

                       s = V*c

(iii) Use the script in Lab 7, item 7, to display the successive
      Haar wavelet approximations to s, from the coarsest scale 
      (Scale 0) to the finest scale (Scale 9).  The vector t
      should be redefined as 0:511 for this part.

(iv)  If y is the approximation to s using Scales 0 to 7 (i.e.,
      excluding Scales 8 and 9), evaluate the relative
      root mean square error

                       norm(s-y)/norm(s)

(v)   In a single graph show s (red) and y (blue) plotted against t.

________

Submit a zip or rar package containing the following files (use exact 
file names as shown):

LASTNAME_LABHW_07.m

	It should contain 

		- the commands used in part (i) to create the vector s;

		- the commands used in part (iv) to compute the relative
		  root mean square error

		- the value of the root mean square error calculated in part (iv)

		- the commands used to generate the graph in part (v)

LASTNAME_LABHW_07.pdf

	The graph generated in part (v)

The zip or rar package should be named as lastname_labhw_07.zip / .rar, and 
should be submitted to the entry for Lab Assignment 7 on ELMS.
