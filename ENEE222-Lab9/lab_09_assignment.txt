LAB ASSIGNMENT 09 - due 11/07
_________________________________

(20 pts.)
	
The signal in the file AUDIO09.wav consists of N samples of a
signal y, which is a modulated version of a bandlimited audio
signal x:

	 y[n] = x[n]*cos(w*n), 	n = 0:N-1

Here, w = K*(2*pi/N) for some K.

The objective is to demodulate y, i.e., obtain x.

i)	 Use WAVREAD to import the vector y. What is its length N 
	 and sampling rate Fs? Listen to y using SOUNDSC.

ii)	 Compute the DFT Y of y and plot its magnitude. Using the 
	 modulation property of the DFT and noting symmetries in 
	 the figure, determine K.

iii) Using the value of K found in (ii), reconstruct the DFT X from Y.

iv)	 Invert X to obtain your version of x (make sure it's real!).
	 Play it back using SOUNDSC to make sure the result is
	 satisfactory. Encode x into a .WAV file using

		 wavwrite(x,Fs,'lastname_labhw_09.wav')

	 (If you get a warning about clipping, replace x by
	  0.99*x/max(abs(x)).)

___________________________________________________________________________

Submit a zip or rar package containing the following files (use exact 
file names as shown):

lastname_labhw_09.m

	 State the values of N, Fs and K, with an explanation of how you 
	 obtained K.  You only need to include the MATLAB code used in
	 obtaining x (time domain) from Y (frequency domain) in steps
 	 (iii) and (iv).  Useful comments should be given.

lastname_labhw_09.wav	
	
	 From (iv) above.

The zip or rar package should be named as lastname_labhw_09.zip / .rar, and 
should be submitted to the entry for Lab Assignment 9 on ELMS.
