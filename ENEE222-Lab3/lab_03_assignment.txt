LAB ASSIGNMENT 3 (due 09/19)
___________________________

A linear filter acts on a complex-valued input sequence u[n] to produce an 
output sequence v[n], where n is an integer representing discrete time.  
At time n, the output sample is given by

	v[n] =  - 0.6*v[n-1] - 0.5*v[n-2] + u[n]	(**)

Suppose that the input sequence u[n] is given by

	u[n] = 0 for n<0

	u[n] = z^n = (a + j*b)^n, for n>=0  (***)

where z is a complex number with real part a and imaginary part b.

We would like to determine those values of a and b on the discrete
grid
	a = -2 : 0.05 : 2 ;

	b = -2 : 0.05 : 2 ;

such that v[n] is a bounded signal, i.e., there exists a finite value M 
such that the magnitude of v[n] is less than M for all n.  Since we need to 
stop at some n, we will use the following criterion for boundedness: 
v[n] is bounded if by time n=1000, all output samples are less than 10^6 
in absolute value.  Those complex numbers that pass the test are saved as
a + j*b in a vector S, which is then plotted (imaginary versus real part).

The idea is very similar to the one developed in Lab 3 for the Mandelbrot 
set. Here are some pointers:

	- Initialize both S and T to [ ] ;

	- Use two nested FOR loops to cover the (a,b) grid.

	- Use the vector vec to store the output samples produced by (**)

	- Initialize vec to [0 0] and n = 0.  In effect, (**) will be used
	  to compute output samples starting at time n = 0, assuming that
	  the outputs at times n = -2 and n = -1 were both zero.

	- Use a WHILE loop that

	- computes the current input u using the formula (***)

	- computes the corresponding output sample v using (**)

	- appends v to vec

	- increments n

	  as long as the output is less than 10^6 in absolute value and
	  the size of vec does not exceed 1002.

	- Append a + j*b to S if the boundedness test is passed; otherwise
	  append a + j*b to T

	- Plot the points in S using . (point) as markers, and those
	  in T using x (x-mark).
