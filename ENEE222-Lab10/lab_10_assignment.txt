LAB ASSIGNMENT 10 - due 11/21
_________________________________

(20 pts.)

	
The signal in the file DIALTONES10.WAV is a sequence of eight DTMF 
tones obtained using a nonstandard set of frequencies (in Hz):

       Frow = [622 715 823 946]

       Fcol = [1183 1360 1565]

The signal vector x was generated using the function DTMFDIAL introduced
in Lab 10, with Frow and Fcol modified as above. Thus

	x = dtmfdial(key_string,Fs,T,Tpause)

The objective is to recover key_string from x.

i)	Use WAVREAD to import the vector x. What is its length N 
	and sampling rate Fs? Listen to x using SOUNDSC.

ii)	Plot x (in the time domain).  Use your plot to estimate the values
	of T and Tpause.

iii)	By examining the magnitude spectra of eight segments selected from
	x, determine key_string.

iv)	Using your results for Fs, T, Tpause and key_string, re-synthesize
	x (as, e.g., x_est) using the function DTMFDIAL with Frow and 
	Fcol modified as above.  Play it back using SOUNDSC to verify
	that it sounds like x.

	State the values of N and Fs, obtained in part (i).  Give your
	estimates of T and Tpause from part (ii).  Give your answer
	for key_string, together with the MATLAB code used to obtain
	key_string.  Useful comments should be given.
