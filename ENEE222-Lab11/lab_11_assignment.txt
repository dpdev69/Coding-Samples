LAB ASSIGNMENT 11 - due 12/05
_____________________________

(15 pts.)


	The surface shown in surfplot11.pdf is "physically" generated
	as follows:

	- A pyramid with square base ([-1,1]x[-1,1]) and vertex 
	at height c = 1.5 above the origin (0,0) is erected.

	- The top of the pyramid is hollowed out by removing the portion
	of it that falls within a sphere of radius r=1 centered at
	the vertex.
	
	Write MATLAB commands that will generate the exact same
	surface plot. Use 200 points for each of the x and y grids,
	the WINTER colormap with flat shading, and viewing angles of 
	70 (azimuth) and 35 (elevation).  Make sure the axes are properly 
	scaled (as shown). Also, use the AXIS TIGHT option.

	Tips:
	
	- Use linspace(-1,1,200), which conveniently skips the origin.

	- Using appropriate inequalities, define four regions on the
	(x,y) plane, making sure the regions cover the entire grid without 
	any overlap among them.  Alternatively, the pyramid can be defined
	in  a single region using a combination of abs(.) and either max(.)
	or min(.)

	- Define a separate region for the footprint (projection) of
	the sphere.

	- Use the MIN function as needed (check documentation).

	The commands for generating the pyramid plot.  It is not necessary
	to submit your surface plot.  Useful comments should be given.

The zip or rar package should be named as lastname_labhw_11.zip / .rar, and 
should be submitted to the entry for Lab Assignment 11 on ELMS.
