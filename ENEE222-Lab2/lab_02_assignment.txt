LAB ASSIGNMENT 2 (due 09/19)
___________________________

In Lab 2, you learned various plotting techniques and created an exponentially faded 
version of a given sinusoidal signal.  In this assignment, you will use the 
so-called Bartlett window to obain a modified sinusoid with symmetric fading
characteristics.

Your code should generate three signal vectors and plot them in a SINGLE figure
consisting of THREE subplots, arranged in a column.  The SUBPLOT function should be
used.  EACH subplot should have labels on the horizontal and vertical axes, as
well as an appropriate title (e.g., INPUT SIGNAL, WINDOW, OUTPUT SIGNAL).


(i) 	Evaluate the signal vector x which contains samples of the sinusoid

		x(t) = cos( 7*pi*t/8 )

	for t = -20:0.01:20 .  Plot x against t in the first subplot.  Calculate number
	of entries in the vector x, and write the result in comments.

(ii)	Type "help bartlett" to read the docummentation on the function BARTLETT. Use
	the command
	
		w = bartlett(N)

	where N takes a suitable value, to generate a vector w having the same
	length as x in part (i).  Plot w against t in the second subplot.

(iii) 	Using the transpose operator and element-by-element multiplication (as needed), 
	"apply" the Bartlett window w to x. This means multiplying each entry of x by
	the corresponding entry of w.  Denote the resulting vector by y.  Plot y
	in the third subplot.
