LAB ASSIGNMENT 6 (due 10/17)
______________________________

(Total Points: 15)

PART 1

- 	Open MATLAB and from there open and study circle-line.fig.
    Note that there are two shapes visible - a circle centered at
    the top-right, and a line from the bottom left to the top-right.

-	As in item 5 in Lab 5, generate a square X-Y grid using
		
		m = 500 ;
		a = 0 : 1/m : 1 ;

        (note that m is higher, so we'll have a larger image)        
        
-	As efficiently as possible, construct a matrix A
	such that

		imshow(flipud(A))

	produces an image identical to circle-line.fig
	
	NOTE: When you do imshow(flipud(A)), x and y are in their "usual"
	      orientation.  That is, x increases to the right, and y
	      increases toward the top of the figure.
    
    A command you may find useful is xor(A, B) which, when applied to
    two logical matrices of the same size, returns logical xor for each
    of the entries in A and B.


PART 2

    Using the method in Lab 6, item 5, determine the total number of singular 
    4x4 symmetric matrices whose entries take values 5, 7, 9, and 11.
    
    Although there are 16 entries in a 4x4 symmetric matrix, there are only 10
    independent values, because 6 are repeats.
    
    NOTE: This computation will take a very long time.  Make sure everything is
          working correctly before you run it for all permutations.
    
    Make a comment which tells the number of singular matrices you calculated.

________

Submit a zip or rar package containing the following file (use the exact 
file name as shown):

lastname_labhw_06.m
        The m-file should contain the MATLAB code for both tasks.  For
		part 2, include the answer (# of singular matrices).  Insert at 
        least one comment, at the most important line in your code; and 
        additional comments that might help the grader better understand 
        your solution and give you partial credit in case of errors.  
        Please put your name and student ID on the first line.

The zip or rar package should be named as lastname_labhw_06.zip / .rar, and 
should be submitted to the entry for Lab Assignment 6 on ELMS.
